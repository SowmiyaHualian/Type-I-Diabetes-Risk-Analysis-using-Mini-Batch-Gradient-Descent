#  Type 1 Diabetes Risk Analysis and Rehabilitation Recommendation System  
### Web-Based AI Chatbot using Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

---

##  Project Description

The **Type 1 Diabetes Risk Analysis and Rehabilitation Recommendation System** is a web-based, AI-driven healthcare application designed to predict diabetes risk and support long-term health monitoring through a conversational chatbot interface. The system enables users to interact naturally by submitting clinical parameters such as **Age, BMI, Blood Glucose, and Insulin/HbA1c**, and receive real-time risk assessment results.

A **Logistic Regression model optimized using Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD)** is employed to ensure efficient and stable model training across heterogeneous medical datasets. Unlike traditional single-time prediction systems, this application maintains a **user-specific historical record** of previous reports and predictions. When new health data is provided, the system compares current and past results to identify trends (**Improving, Stable, or Worsening**) and dynamically generates **personalized rehabilitation recommendations**.

By integrating machine learning, backend development, database management, and an interactive web interface, the project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end AI healthcare decision-support system** with real-world applicability.

##  Key Goals

- To develop a **conversational AI-based system** for diabetes risk analysis  
- To apply **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** for efficient and scalable machine learning optimization  
- To enable **continuous health monitoring** through historical data comparison  
- To provide **personalized rehabilitation recommendations** based on user trends  
- To design and implement a **fully functional web application**, not just a standalone ML model

##  Objectives

1. To collect and preprocess relevant clinical features from multiple publicly available diabetes datasets  
2. To build and train a **Logistic Regression model** optimized using **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**  
3. To predict diabetes risk probability and classify it into **Low, Moderate, or High** risk levels  
4. To design a **secure user authentication system** with persistent data storage  
5. To maintain **user-specific historical health records** for longitudinal analysis  
6. To compare previous and current predictions to determine **health progression trends**  
7. To generate **dynamic rehabilitation recommendations** based on risk level and trend analysis  
8. To create an **interactive chatbot-style web interface** for intuitive user interaction

- `diabetes.csv`  
- `diabetes_data.csv`  
- `diabetes_data_upload.csv`  
- `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`
